Aerodynamics of Planes Ever since I was little I was amazed at the ability for a machine to fly.  I have always wanted to explore ideas of flight and be able to actually fly.  I think I may have found my childhood fantasy in the world of aeronautical engineering.  The object of my paper is to give me more insight on my future career as an aeronautical engineer.  This paper was also to give me ideas of the physics of flight and be to apply those physics of flight to compete in a high school competition. 
History of Flight The history of flying dates back as early as the fifteenth century.  A Renaissance man named Leonardo da Vinci introduced a flying machine known as the ornithopter.  Da Vinci proposed the idea of a machine that had …show more content…

Towards the end of the War the airplane becomes a practical device of war being able to carry weapons.  Anthony Fokker and Louis Bleriot create the most successful of early modern biplanes known as the D-VII and D-VIII.  Biplanes are eventually taken over by the monoplane, or one wing.  This new design allowed for faster flight and better visibility for the pilot.  Air-cooled engines lead the way for commercial aircraft, and Boeing introduces the first modern airliner the 247.  Airplanes are effected the greatest by supply and demand of war.  New styles of war begun to emerge so did new and improved types of aircraft.  The population of the U.S. also begun to grow which leads to the modern most sophisticated commercial airliner the 777.  Most aircraft improvements are found in the military and intelligence field.  The most high tech aircraft known today for such things as spying are the SR-71 Blackbird, and the U-2 Spy plane.  The most complicated and best aircraft performance is still held by the space shuttle and probably always will be.  The last 200 years have seen incredible changes in aircraft from the man with wings to heavier than air flying machines that can travel at supersonic speeds.
